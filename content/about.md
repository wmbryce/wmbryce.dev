Me.
<br/>
<br/>
I struggle to write about myself. I find it difficult to find the tone which stikes the balance between sarcasm, self deprecating humor, and subtle back handed compliments that I usually use to express myself.  
<br/>
<br/>
I born in and raised in the once sleeply little town of Austin Texas. I recently fled Texas for the more mountanous country of Colorado, specifically Denver.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm passionate about technology and using it to make the world a better place. In order to accomplish that I direct engineering at a small healthcare start up called PatchRx.
<br/><br/>
At Patch, I work to help implement and design techological solutions to help increase medication adherence. Medication adherence is a fancy term which refers to how accurately people follow their prescribed medication routine. With Patch, I developed a Mobile and Web application completely from scratch. I also architected the supporting cloud infrastructure for both products using a combination of API gateway, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, AuoraDB, AWS Cognito & Amplify.
<br/>
<br/>
When I'm not working I enjoy<br/>
baking bread,<br/>
cooking risotto,<br/>
reading big books,<br/>
climbing big rocks,<br/>
and making music (guitar & piano).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to get me going ask me about my emacs configuration.
