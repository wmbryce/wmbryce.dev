Me.

Ah yes. About me. 

The balance of pretentious self aggrandizement and humble brags is tricky.

From Austin Texas currently living in Denver. 

I'm a project manager and lead software architect at PatchRx.

When I'm not working I love to
bake cookies,
cook risotto,
read big books, 
climb big rocks,
play music (guitar & piano),
& even hit the tennis ball (if the weather is nice)

I'm passionate about programming and making the world a better place. 
Some times I even just program all weekend just for the hell of it.

oh. And I like emacs.
