<br/>
I was born and raised in Austin, Texas, but recently fled Texas for the more mountainous country of Denver Colorado.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm passionate about technology and using it to make the world a more equitable, accessable place. I spent most of my college career building small portable synthesizers and cryptocurrency mining rigs in the computer lab. After finishing school, I joined a few friends who were starting a medical technology start-up called PatchRx.
<br/>
<br/>
At Patch, I was able to pursue my passion for building things. I developed an MVP mobile and web application for PatchRx, and helped to manage the products and the engineering team. During this time, I have developed my skills as an engineer using the latest tools and best practices. I have also had the opportunity to develop my skills as a manager, helping to bring innovative ideas to life and fostering new and interesting relationships along the way.

When I'm not working I enjoy
<br/>
baking bread,
<br/>
cooking risotto,
<br/>
reading big books,
<br/>
climbing big rocks,
<br/>
and making music (guitar & piano).
