Me.
<br/>
<br/>
Ah yes. About me.
<br/>
<br/>
Finding balance between pretentious self aggrandizement and humble brags is difficult for me.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm an Austin Texas native, currently living in Denver.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently the directory of engineering at PatchRx.
<br/><br/>
So far working at PatchRx I have built the a Mobile app and a Web app from scratch. I have also built out the cloud infrastructure for both products using a combination of API gateway, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, AuoraDB, AWS Cognito. I love coding right now I perfer to use React/React Native as my brush, with some ES6 and some Typescript. I'm also proficent with python and Scala.
<br/>
<br/>
When I'm not working I enjoy<br/>
baking bread,<br/>
cooking risotto,<br/>
reading big books,<br/>
climbing big rocks,<br/>
and playing music (guitar & piano).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm passionate about programming and making the world a better place.
